# Spaceship-and-Asteroids

Hi! This is a project I created during a summer program in high school.

The idea for this project is gotten from an [online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-2).
I developed the project from a basic template that included art and other assets that were supplied by this online course.
Moving forward from the basic template, the project is developed entirely by myself.


This project deals with a maneuverable(using arrow keys) spaceship that can shoot(using space bar) asteroids. You have a certain amount of lives
and score of the number of asteroids destroyed is kept track of. The asteroids are spawned randomly and holding up arrow will cause your ship to accelerate.
The project displays my knowledge of Python, Object-Oriented Programming, data structures, functions, game physics, and UI. 


To run the program locally, you need to have run the command `pip install simpleguitk`.

If you are having trouble running the program locally for whatever reason, [here is an online IDE containing the program](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user49_HH4FqCrI0S_5.py).
